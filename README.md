# Madhav Ecommerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is an interactive *Sales Analytics Dashboard* built in *Power BI* using a public Kaggle dataset.  
The dashboard helps understand how a single store is performing in terms of *sales, profit, and quantity sold* across different time periods.

## 🎯 Objective

- Track *total sales, profit, and quantity* for the store  
- Identify *high–demand months and quarters*  
- Analyse *which product categories and sub-categories* are performing well  
- Provide a simple, interactive view for non-technical users using *slicers and filters*

---

- Source: *Kaggle (E-commerce / Store sales dataset)*
- Key columns used:
  - Order Date
